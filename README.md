# DependencyInjection

A microframework for dependency injection based on the service locator pattern utilizing Swift's property wrappers.

## Usage
On App start register dependencies by overriding AppDelegate's initializer:
```Swift
import DependencyInjection
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    @LazyInject private var config: AppConfiguration
    @LazyInject private var router: Router

    override init() {
        super.init()

        DIContainer.register {
            Shared(AppConfigurationImpl() as AppConfiguration)
            Shared(RouterImpl() as Router)
        }
    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        // use `config` and `router`

        return true
    }
}
```
### Lazy vs eager evaluation
As the initializers of the injected properties the example above would be called before the AppDelegate's initializer, it's necessary to separate usage and initialization of the injected property. `@LazyInject` will only resolve when its property is first accessed. To resolve properties eagerly use `@Inject` instead.

### Optional dependencies
Dependencies that under certain circumstances cannot be resolved can simply be marked as `Optional`s.
```Swift
@Inject var player: MediaPlayer?
```
If no `MediaPlayer` instance is registered, `player` resolves to `nil`.
Note: If an Optional would be registered `player` also resolves to `nil` as the registered type is not the expected `MediaPlayer` but `Optional<MediaPlayer>` in this case.

### Shared vs new instances
Registering a dependency as `Shared` will always resolve to the same (identical) instance. To get a new instance in each property use `New`:
```Swift
DIContainer.register(New(MockRouter.init as Router))
```
By doing so registrations made in production code could for example be overridden by mock objects in tests that are not shared across objects.

### Aliases
Instances can also be registered with multiple alias protocols that each only expose certain parts of their functionality:
```Swift
DIContainer.register(Shared(RouterImpl.init, as: Router.self, DeeplinkHandler.self))
```

### Registering dependencies that have dependencies themselves
In case the registered dependencies depend on other dependencies themselves that should be passed via initializer injection there are overloads for registering `Shared` and `New` instances that pass a `Resolver` object in a closure:
```Swift
DIContainer.register {
    Shared { resolve in RouterImpl(config: resolve()) }
}
```

### Usage without property wrappers
As property wrappers can currently not be used inside function bodies, dependencies can be resolved "manually":
```Swift
func foo() {
    DIContainer.resolve(Router.self)
}
```

or if the compiler can infer the type to resolve:
```Swift
func foo() {
    bar(router: DIContainer.resolve())
}

func bar(router: Router) {
    // â€¦
}
```
